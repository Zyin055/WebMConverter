Simple utility program written in Java to help convert videos into .webm format. It allows you to modify settings such as bitrate and compression so you can get the optimal output video quality/size. Also supports custom start/end times with a screenshot previews to help you make short .webm's instead of converting the entire video.

ffmpeg.exe is required for this program and must be located next to the downloaded WebMConverter.jar file. It is included with the download.
